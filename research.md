<!-- ## Corporate Innovation

Nowadays, with the rapid rise of technologies such as artificial intelligence, robots and quantum communication, innovation has become to be a business imperative, rather than  icing on the cake. Although investment in R&D is crutial for a firm's survival and long-term profit, investors may not always support it. Cases are that investors feel hard to determine whether the low current profit arises from augmenting spending on R&D or bad operation. As a result, investors with different information positions have different incentives to vote for innovative projects. In particular, my work provides evidence of whether and how the common institutional investors facilitate innovative cooperations among firms in their portfolios.

**Common Institutional Ownership and Cooperation in Innovation**  
(with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jbcui2013/">Jingbo Cui</a>)  
Common institutional ownerships in two firms increases the frequency of their cooperation in innovation, particular when these two firms are located in the same province and lie in similar technology positions.

## Auction and Contest

Most greate ideas for enhacing corporate growth and profits come from the people who daily fight for the company's battles, who serve the customers, explore new markets and fend off the competition (Spender and Strong, 2010). In other word, well-designed incentives and regulations on employees can make the corporates healthier; while bad compensation schemes seems to be typically slow-acting poisons. Related to this, I've written a theoretical paper to discuss the relationships among wage schemes, competition balance and total efforts. -->

<!-- **Caps on All-pay Auctions with Stochastic Abilities**   
An effort cap (meaning that employees whose efforts equal to this bound share the opportunity to win the prize) can induce employees with middle-level abilities to make more efforts by increasing their probability to win, while restricting the efforts of workers with high-level abilities.
